"Table S2: RNA-seq transcriptome analysis of S. aureus USA300 wild type cells after exposure to AGXX® stress. S. aureus USA300 wild type cells were grown in 3 biological replicates and harvested before and after 30 min exposure to 4.5 µg/ml AGXX®. The RNA-isolation and RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis was performed as described in the Methods section. Transcripts were analyzed for differential expression using the software DEseq2 included in the ReadXplorer v2.2 software. The signal intensity value (A-value) was calculated by log2 mean of normalized read counts and the signal intensity ratio (M-value) by log2-fold change. The evaluation of the differential RNAseq data was performed using an adjusted p-value cut-off of P ≤ 0.05 and a signal intensity ratio/log2-fold changes (M-value) cut-off of ≥ 0.6 or ≤ - 0.6. Genes were classified into regulons according to the RegPrecise database and those published previously (Mäder et al., 2016). Only those regulons are shown with significant induced or repressed genes under AGXX®-treatment in S. aureus. Significantly induced regulons are highligthed in Fig. 2  and printed bold and boxed with thick lines. Log2-fold changes (M-values) and fold changes of induced genes are colour coded from yellow (0.6) to red (10) for log2-fold changes and from yellow (1.5) to red (100) for fold changes.","","","","","",NA,NA,""
